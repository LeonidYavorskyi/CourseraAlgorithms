1. Queue with two stacks. Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.
   Hint: If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they appear in reverse order. If you repeat this process, they're now back in order.

2. Stack with max. Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation.
   Assume the elements are reals numbers so that you can compare them.
   Hint: Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximums.

3. Java generics. Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.
   Arrays don’t support type erasure, the parametrized type  T does not exist at run-time, the compiler cannot assign a run-time  type to the array created.
   Hint: to start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but Java generics are not: that is, 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐[] is a subtype of 𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝[], but 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐> is not a subtype of 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>.
